# Spotify Mimic


This project is a starting point for my Flutter experience.

It will simply be an extension of my previous attempts at mimicking Spotify using plain HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), jQuery/JS for one, and React for another.
However, this will be the first attempt at mobile application development too (even though Flutter can compile to any platform necessary, I am mainly using it for Android).
